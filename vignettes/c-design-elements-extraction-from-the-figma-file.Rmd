# Transformation of the raw Figma content to a tibble with only the design description of the main components: `raw_to_design_tibble()`

This function is used to arrange the raw data (list) to a digest tibble. Only the information about main components is keept. Only the items corresponding to a design characteristic is kept (color, style, opacity, etc.).


```{r}
raw_file_content <- get_figma_file_content(file_key = "wRqIvMmymzSPuj0sEhnORb",
                                           acess_token = Sys.getenv("FIGMA_TOKEN"))

raw_file_content %>% raw_to_design_tibble()
```

```{r examples-raw_to_design_tibble}
data(toy_raw_file_content)
toy_raw_file_content %>% raw_to_design_tibble()
```
